                    <p>I'm a software engineer, currently seeking full-time opportunities. I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Florida, and I am positive that I can be resourceful with the challenges of product development.
                        Previously a Software Developer at Mercedes Benz Research and Development India, I worked on developing Cabin Infotainment software and helped to streamline workflows through automation by 12%. Prior to that, I interned at a startup focussing on developing SaaS-based web platforms.
                        My professional experience has helped me develop strong design skills and clean code practices. Apart from working on various technologies pertaining to a project, one of the most important things I have learnt was to approach problem solving at an enterprise level and collaborate with team mates to deliver a high-quality product while meeting deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through the summer of 2020, I had a great internship experience at Trader Interactive. With 9+ million monthly users, it was valuable to learn about developing scalable and robust systems.
I like to engage in getting hands-on with new technologies and learning more through doing projects. Check out my GitHub linked below for some of my work.</p>
